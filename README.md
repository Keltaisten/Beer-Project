# Beer-Project

The BeerManager is an application that read Beer datas from JSON file and insert it to database.
The user can get several information about the Beer data like:
 - Group beers by brand
 - Filter beers by type
 - Get the cheapest brand
 - Get ids that lack from specific ingredient
 - Sort all beers by remaining ingredient ratio
 - List beers based on their price with a tip
 - Round all price to hundred
 - Delete beer by beer id

The information can be write to the console or to JSON file.

I made the project in Java SE program language.
I used IDEA for development environment and Maven for build.
I used MariaDb and JDBCTemplate on the repository level for making connection with database.
I also used HeidiSQL for checking datas.
I made JUnit and integrated tests.
I took Jackson to read and write JSON files.
